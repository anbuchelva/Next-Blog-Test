There are many ways to write and publish blog posts, when it comes to git backed static websites.

I used use,

1. Text editor for writing & terminal for building process
2. Netlify CMS - an open sourced content management system
3. Now trying [forestry.io](https://forestry.io "Forestry.IO") as CMS for this hexo blog.

{% note info %}

There is a post that explains how to {% post_link integrate-netlify-cms-with-hexo %}.  You may refer it, which will be useful to understand the CMS on hexo platform.
