### The Beginning
I was born in a small town of Tamil Nadu, India; completed my graduation in a Government college in the same town. Spent another 4 years in working in the same place for supporting Government of Tamil Nadu.

After spending 20+ years in the same town, I thought of moving out of my comfort zone and started exploring the world. So, I got a job opportunity at Chennai the Capital of Tamil Nadu.

### Life at Office Tiger (aka) RR Donnelley
Office Tiger[^1] gave me a Job to survive in this city. I spent very little time ~10 months in the company, worked for a Presentation centre of an [Investment Bank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goldman_Sachs). I have gained proper knowledge in Microsoft Office Packages; made me an expert on it. I have cleared their _GStyle Assessment_, which is a mandate to clear all the people who join the team; scored 99.3% which was never scored by anyone before.  Sadly, I didn't get any proof/certificate due to the _not-to-disclose-the-client-name_ policy.  Also, awarded as {% label success@Shining Star of The Team %} for my time management Skills.

[^1]: It was later acquired by [RR Donnelley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RR_Donnelley).

### Golden Period of My Life at HCL
When I was struggling to survive, [HCL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HCL_Technologies) offered me a job to **Live** my life. We worked in a pilot batch by supporting [Office Depot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Office_Depot). This is the place I have identified my passion towards data, especially in handling large data.

This place made me to learn a lot starting from Microsoft Access, Cognos Query Studio & Report Studio in the technical front.  Also proved that 99% accuracy is not enough by making me to know about Six Sigma.

The console that I have designed using a centralized Access database as front-end for tracking the requests received from client, process flow, quality checks, re-works, productivity for each of the task gained me {% label success@Outstanding Performer %} rating in all the appraisal reviews. I started it as a side project, which I haven't expected to survive and used extensively for 10+ years; 7+ years without major maintenance after I left HCL.

This is the place, where I met my future wife ðŸ’“ and few life time friends.

I expected a good growth in my career based on my performance and we were the pilot batch of the project.  Sadly the recession hit it very hardly.  The team size expects to grow 5 times bigger before the recession, but actually it was reduced 4 times lesser. So, the hope of growth came to nil, which made me to look for other opportunities.

### The Sutherland Era
I joined [Sutherland](https://www.linkedin.com/company/sutherland-global-services) at the end of 2010, spent 8+ years ðŸ˜® in my life; currently serving notice period expect to relive from my duties in a week time. 

#### The Person Who Makes Better Plan
I was given 3 opportunities when I joined here.
1. Forecast/Plan Manpower - Manpower is the most important asset of any outsourcing company
2. Plan Capacity/Seats - Planning Seats is one of the complex tasks when the organization is staffed with large number of people working in different shifts.
3. Reporting - Maintaining the history is also important to plan the future
   
I said that, I am open to anything.  I know that choosing reporting would be an easy option and I can prove myself very quick. I was given an option to plan manpower, which I had zero experience.  I had good experience in handling large data and to understand it.  But making projections based on history was a real challenge.  The hiring and training should happen based on my inputs well in advance.  There would a huge impact on costs, if I make a small mistake.

It took few months to become an expert and started building models for each type of billing models.  There was a comment made by a senior executive that,

>If you are an English speaking customer and if you are looking for support in Anti Virus, most probably you would call Sutherland.

I was doing the manpower projection for different clients, though my all time support was given to [McAfee Anti Virus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/McAfee).  They have appreciated my work, recognized and given a task to plan their technical/customer support model for the newly launched Mobile Support business.

I would say that,

>If you have reach out to McAfee Support for Anti Virus related issues from 2010 to 2013, I have made projection that you would call McAfee ðŸ˜‰

#### Financial Planning > Manpower Planning
I am really bad in giving interviews, though [Kumari Umapathy](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kumariumapathy/), who was a Senior Director, was heading the Enterprise Performance Management team trusted me and gave an opportunity to join the the team. Our team technically supports the financial planning and consolidation of the organization. I was expecting a small learning curve because I had better experience on Sutherland's process; however, it was not.

I had to spend many hours in reading the Essbase Technical Reference then the Admin Guide, Hyperion Planning Technical Reference and Admin Guide which are the base to the new process. Then I have gone through the boot camp training sessions from Oracle unlimited learning.  I'm still a drop of the Essbase Ocean.

If I draw a chart based on the time I spent for learning, Essbase & Hyperion Planning would be placed next to my entire school days.

When my direct supervisor [Dan Gagnon](https://ca.linkedin.com/in/dan-gagnon-56b05249) left Sutherland, I had to place myself in his place and gone through lot of struggles in maintaining the existing application.  I was living like a kid, till that time.  That gave me a wonderful opportunity to work on a project based on [Hyperion Profitability and Cost Management (aka) HPCM](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/middleware/profit-cost-management/overview/index.html). The HPCM - Management Leger is relatively new to the market, where there were no many guidelines. I have spent enormous amount of time in working on the project, as I have to learn everything new.

I started writing stuff related to [Hyperion](/Hyperion) in this blog. There are large number of sources available in the web. I write something that, I couldn't find in the web or some experience that I have gone through - discovered new.

There are few important occasions of my life happened when I am at Sutherland, which I could never forget.
1. Got married as I wished
2. Blessed with a beautiful and talented baby
3. I purchased a house
