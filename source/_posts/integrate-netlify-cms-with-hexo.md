People create blogs and start writing posts frequently in the beginning and stops it gradually to zero.  I guess there are 3 types are people who writes blog.

1. Who sees the platform as fresh, creates a blog starts writing a post or two then forget
2. Who setup a blog, spending more time on tweaking than actually writing
3. Who doeesn't create a blog, opt the ready-made one available in the market such as [Medium](https://medium.com)

I feel there should be a medium to write something like a paper, notebook, diary to convert a thought that flash in our mind to a post or article.  When the {% label @gap %} increases on converting a thought to writing, it will never be written. The medium is the main obstacle that reduces the frequency of blog posts and makes to zero at the end.

I started writing in this blog in a text editor, push it to git.  I have to write it only on my personal computer, where git installed.  When I don't have a computer with git installed, the {% label @gap %} increases.  I want to get rid of the obstacle.

Found [netlify-cms](https://www.netlifycms.org/) as the better alternate to write blog posts.
