# Android Builds
I'm an Android enthusiast and support open source projects.  

One of my hobby is to build after market firmwares for the android devices that I own.  I have build few ROMs for my personal use with the latest security updates.  All my works are available in [Android File Host](https://androidfilehost.com/?w=devices&uid=95784891001602557).

My notable contributions are listed here.

* [Lineage OS 16](https://www.androidfilehost.com/?w=files&flid=314500) Build for Mido aka Xiaomi Redmi Note 4/4x
* [AOSP-OMS](https://forum.xda-developers.com/mi-4i/rom-aosp-rro-t3433717/) for Ferrari aka Xiaomi Mi4i
* [Slim Roms](https://forum.xda-developers.com/mi-4i/slim-ferrari-6-0-1-alpha-0-7-unofficial-t3431751/) for Ferrari aka Xiaomi Mi4i
