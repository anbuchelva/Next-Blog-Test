summary: After joining Standard Chartered Bank, life was not the same as before.  There's
  always work, even after we start working from home. Every other people I meet online
  prepare watchlist in Netflix and Amazon Prime, I struggle to get time to learn something
  new. So, I took a week off and stayed away completely from work except few phone
  calls.  This post is about the week my experiments with Oracle Cloud and few personal
  projects.
