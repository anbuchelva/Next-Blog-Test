summary: A normal person accessing email or other online services satisfies with the
  simple password for protection from unauthorised access. When someone bit paranoid,
  start using strong password, then adds 2 factor authentication as SMS OTP, Time
  Based OTP, security key, etc., Zoho made this 2nd factor authentication to a next
  level, which none of the other services offer.
