A normal person accessing email or other online services satisfies with the simple password for protection from unauthorised access. When someone bit paranoid, start using strong password, then adds 2 factor authentication such as SMS OTP or Time Based OTP or Hardware Security key, etc., Zoho made this 2nd factor authentication to a next level, which none of the other services offer.

If you are reading this, I hope you already know about [zoho](https://www.zoho.com/) who provides a large number of services for businesses. I watched them to grow, felt joining them when I start my career in IT. I am an user of their products made for individuals. I still use their email, purchased this domain from them, using their email services for creating email accounts with my domain name, etc., All at free of cost[^1].

[^1]: Domain was free for the first year, with some restrictions.
